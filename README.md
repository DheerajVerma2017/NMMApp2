1. Prerequisites (Install Once)
Make sure the new system has:
- Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node)

Check with:
   node -v
   npm -v
If not installed: Download https://nodejs.org/en

✅ 2. Clone the Project:
  git clone https://github.com/DheerajVerma2017/NMMApp2
  cd NMMApp2

✅ 3. Install Project Dependencies
Run this inside the project folder (where package.json is):
  npm install
This installs all dependencies defined in package.json.

✅ 4. Run the Development Server
  npm run dev
Vite will start the dev server and give you a URL like:
Local:   http://localhost:5173/
Open it in your browser to see your app.
